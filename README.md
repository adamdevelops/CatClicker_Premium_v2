# Cat Clicker Premium v2 


## Description:

A web application that gives a selection of cats to click on from a menu. This is a revision of the Cat Clicker Premium v1 which enhances the readability/strucutre of the code by refactoring it into a MVC (Model View Controller) / MVO(Model View Octopus; Udacity's convention of MVC) format. By refactoring the code this way, this makes the code more easier to tweak in the future for improvements without breaking any parts of the MVC functionality.

This app was made as an assignment from Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree.
